Threads are independent part of same program which can be executed cocurrently .

Threads are created in two ways

1. Extending thread class
2. Implementing Runnable interface

Thread Priority -->  1->low 5->normal 10->highest


Multiple thread trying to access same object at the same time
is called as Race condtn 

Race condtn always leads to data inconsistency

Thread Synchronization

* synchronized methods
* synchronized blocks

Thread Deadlock -> its a situation where two threads will be waiting
                   to acquire object lock of each other for infinite
                   period of time.
                   
Inter Thread Communication(ITC)

sleep()  : it will pause the thread execution and do not release object lock.
wait()   : it will pause the thread execution and also release object lock.
notify() : it will communicate its termination status to other thread
           which is in wait state.
notifyAll() : it will communicate its termination status to all the
              other threads which are in wait state.
