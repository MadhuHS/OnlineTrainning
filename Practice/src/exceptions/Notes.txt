 throws and throw keywords
 
 exception propagation : Passing the exception object from called method
                         to calling method is known exception propagation.
 
 UnChecked Exceptions will be implicitly propagated by the JVM.
 
 throws keyword : used to propagate checked exceptions from called method
                  to calling method by the programmer explicitly.
 
 throw keyword : used to throw the exceptions explicitly by the programmer
