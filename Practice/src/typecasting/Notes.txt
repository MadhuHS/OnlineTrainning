Type-casting -> converting one type to another type

# Primitive casting --> Widening -->Convt lower data type value to higher datatype value
                    --> Narrowing-->Convt higher data type value to lower datatype value
# Derived casting 

byte   8bits
short  16bits
char   16bits
int    32bits
long   64bits
float  32bits
double 64bits

# boolean type can't be typecasted.

# Derived casting -> converting reference of on class type to another class type

* Inheritance is mandatory for DERIVED CASTING

Up-casting -->  converting subclass refr. 
                 to superclass refr.

*Upcasting is done by storing addrs. of subclass object 
           in superclass refr. var
* Any Superclass ref.Variable pointing object 
  of Subclass is called as upcasted refr.

* using upcasted refr. u can access only superclass prop.

Down-casting
* converting the upcasted ref. back to subclass refr.
* it should be done by prog. by writting casting stmt.

----***USING UPCASTED REFR. IF WE CALL AN OVERRIDEN METHOD THEN WE ALWAYS
GET THE OVRRIDEN IMPL. OF SUBCLASS***----

Derived casting can be done 
        using CONCRETE CLASSES,ABSTRACT CLASSES and INTERFACES
